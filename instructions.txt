Sofia Health Engineer
Sofia Health is a Django CMS–based health and wellness platform handling bookings, payments, and provider management. 
We’re looking for someone who can maintain and extend a Django-based system with Stripe integration and scheduling features.

This short assessment is designed to show your comfort with Django, Stripe, and explaining your thinking.


In this assessment, you will be submitting your solution using git. 
To do so, you will need to clone the repo linked above, 
and push all your changes to the dev branch (which is also the default branch). 
You will be submitting this assessment by creating a pull request between the dev and the main branch.

If you need help with how to clone the repo to work on the project locally, see this link for help.

Part 1: Core Skills (Hands-On)
Build a very simple Django project that demonstrates:
A model for Appointment with fields: provider_name, appointment_time, and client_email.
A form or API endpoint to create an appointment.
A mock payment flow using Stripe's test keys (no need to set up webhooks or full checkout – just show 
you can create a test PaymentIntent or CheckoutSession).
Deliverables:
A GitHub repo or zipped project uploaded to Hatchways with code and setup instructions.
A short README explaining how to run the project and how the Stripe integration works.

Part 2: Problem-Solving & Communication
Answer briefly (one paragraph each):
If this appointment feature had to handle thousands of bookings per day, what one or two changes would you make first?
How would you communicate progress and blockers to a non-technical founder?
Plain English is fine – we want to see how you explain your thinking.
What We're Looking For
Python/Django familiarity: Clean, minimal code.
Stripe familiarity: Ability to integrate test payments.
Communication: Clear, non-technical explanations.

Submitting Your Solution

Open a pull request from dev into main once you are ready to submit. 
Do not merge the pull request. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to create a pull request.
